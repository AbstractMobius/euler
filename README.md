My submissions to Project Euler *https://projecteuler.net/*

This directory serves the purpose to showcase the manner in which I go about solving difficult problems.

The problems become more difficult the higher the number, so I would recommend observing my solutions to the higher numbered problems rather than the lower numbered problems, as they are much more difficult.

**Please note that this is NOT a reflection of my ability to design maintainable code, but is a reflection of my problem solving ability**
